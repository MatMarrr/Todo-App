## Created using HTML5, CSS3, JS and jQuery

A simple todo app that allows users to add, complete, and delete todos. Users can sort todos based on their current status. All todos are stored in local storage, so when the user comes back, his todos will be saved. All todos can be removed from local storage with the "Clear All" button.
